# @dataclass
class Runnable(metaclass=_ExecutableMeta):
    """
    Wrapper for executable operations with scheduling and status tracking capabilities.
    
    Runnable provides a unified interface for wrapping any executable operation (Transform,
    Downloader, Validator, etc.) with additional features like scheduling, thread tracking,
    and status management. It acts as an adapter between executables and the Runner framework,
    allowing any class with a `run()` method to be orchestrated by Runner.
    
    The class uses a factory pattern (`make()` classmethod) to dynamically create subclasses
    that combine Runnable functionality with existing executable classes, enabling seamless
    integration without modifying source code.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    executable : Optional[Any]
        The underlying executable object to be run by the Runner. Typically an instance
        of Transform, Downloader, Validator, or any class implementing `run()` and `arun()`.
        Set via the `make()` factory method or manually after initialization.
    
    thread_id : Optional[str]
        Unique identifier for the thread executing this runnable. Used for tracking
        and debugging concurrent execution. Assigned at runtime by the executor.
    
    status : Literal["in_progress", "queued", "completed", "inactive"]
        Current execution status of the runnable. Possible states:
        - "inactive": Runnable has not been executed (default)
        - "queued": Runnable is waiting to be executed
        - "in_progress": Runnable is currently executing
        - "completed": Runnable has finished execution successfully
    
    scheduler : Optional[Scheduler]
        Optional scheduler for repeated or delayed execution. If set, the runnable
        executes repeatedly according to the scheduler's interval. Enables periodic
        jobs, delayed execution, or event-driven scheduling.
    
    Examples
    --------
    Using the factory pattern to create a runnable from an executable:
    
    >>> from transforms import ValueMapping
    >>> mapping_executable = ValueMapping(column='age', mapping={...}, default=0, alias='age_group')
    >>> MappingRunnable = Runnable.make(ValueMapping)
    >>> 
    >>> mapping_runnable = MappingRunnable(column='age', mapping={...}, default=0, alias='age_group')
    >>> result = mapping_runnable.run(df)
    
    With a scheduler for repeated execution:
    
    >>> from scheduler import Scheduler
    >>> extract_transform = ExtractTransform()
    >>> 
    >>> # Create runnable with scheduler
    >>> ExtractRunnable = Runnable.make(Extract)
    >>> extract_runnable = ExtractRunnable(source='api.json')
    >>> extract_runnable.scheduler = Scheduler(time_delta_in_seconds=3600)
    >>> 
    >>> # Will execute every hour and yield results
    >>> for result in extract_runnable.run(initial_data):
    ...     process(result)
    
    Combining runnables in a pipeline:
    
    >>> ExtractRunnable = Runnable.make(Extract)
    >>> TransformRunnable = Runnable.make(Transform)
    >>> LoadRunnable = Runnable.make(Load)
    >>> 
    >>> extract = ExtractRunnable(source='data.csv')
    >>> transform = TransformRunnable(transforms=[normalize, deduplicate])
    >>> load = LoadRunnable(destination='warehouse')
    >>> 
    >>> runner = Runner(runnables=[extract, transform, load])
    >>> result = runner.run(None)
    
    Notes
    -----
    - The factory pattern (`make()`) is the recommended way to create Runnables
    - Status is managed by the executor during pipeline execution
    - Thread IDs are assigned by concurrent executors for thread-safe tracking
    - Scheduled runnables yield multiple results over time; non-scheduled return single results
    - Any class with `run()` and `arun()` methods can be wrapped as a Runnable

        """
        Factory method to dynamically create a Runnable subclass from any executable class.
        
        This is the recommended pattern for wrapping existing executables. It combines
        the Runnable class with any class that implements a `run()` method, creating a
        new class that inherits from both. This allows seamless integration of existing
        executables into the Runner framework without modifying their source code.
        
        The resulting class can be instantiated like the original class but with all
        Runnable features (scheduling, status tracking, thread management).
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        bclass : type
            The base class to be wrapped. Must have a `run()` method. Typically an
            executable class like Transform, Downloader, Validator, Extract, Load, etc.
        
        Returns
        -------
        type
            A new class that inherits from both the provided class and Runnable.
            Can be instantiated with the same arguments as bclass.
        
        Raises
        ------
        AttributeError
            If the provided class does not have a `run()` method.
        
        Examples
        --------
        >>> from transforms import ValueMapping
        >>> MappingRunnable = Runnable.make(ValueMapping)
        >>> 
        >>> # Use exactly like the original class, but with Runnable features
        >>> runnable = MappingRunnable(column='status', mapping={'a': 1, 'b': 2})
        >>> result = runnable.run(df)
        
        >>> from downloaders import S3Downloader
        >>> S3Runnable = Runnable.make(S3Downloader)

        Notes
        -----
        - The factory creates a new class each time it's called
        - The resulting class initialization calls both parent constructors
        - Callable multiple times on the same class to create independent Runnable types
